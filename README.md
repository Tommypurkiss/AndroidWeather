ABOUT:

Not yet named, but this weather app will be a simple and easy to use application for Android. Currently programmed in Java.
Creating to learn more and improve my Java/Android skills further.



TODO:

  - Choose a location and have that locations weather data also parse through json and siplay it on screen

- Include a settings menu 
  - Change units from M/I/K
  - Be able to save locations

- Improve the UI/UX

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED:

- Using the OpenWeatherMap API
- Parsing the JSON data and with JSONObjects and JSONArrays
- Calling the data and displaying it visually
- Being able to find the weather data based on the devices location through geographic coordinates
